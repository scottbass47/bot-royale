    /// An algorithm for testing whether a given graph is cyclic or acyclic, i.e. does a given graph have 
    /// a connectivity cycle.
    /// 
    /// Method.
    /// =======
    /// 1) We loop over all nodes in the network and perform a depth-first traversal from each node. 
    /// (Note. the order that the nodes are traversed does not affect the correctness of the method)
    /// 
    /// 2) Each traversal keeps track of its ancestor nodes (the path to the current node) at each step
    /// in the traversal. Thus if the traversal encounters an ancestor node then a cycle has been detected.
    /// 
    /// 3) A set of visited nodes is maintained. This persists between traversals and allows each traversal 
    /// to avoid traversing into nodes that have already been traversed.
    /// 
    /// Note. We must traverse from each node rather then just e.g. the input nodes, because the network may 
    /// have connectivity dead ends or even isolated connectivity that therefore would not be traversed into 
    /// by following connectivity from the input nodes only, hence we perform a traversal from each node and
    /// attempt to maintain algorithmic efficiency by avoiding traversal into nodes that have already been 
    /// traversed into.
    /// 
    /// The graph traversal algorithm uses function recursion. A number of other classes in SharpNEAT perform
    /// graph traversal by using a separate traversal stack (stored on the heap); that approach is faster but
    /// more complex, thus this class has not been converted to the faster approach because it is not directly 
    /// used in the evolutionary algorithm. At time of writing this class is used only in Debug.Assert statements
    /// and unit tests, thus the simpler implementation is more appropriate.
