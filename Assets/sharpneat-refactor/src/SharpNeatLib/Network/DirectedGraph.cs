    /// Overview
    /// --------
    /// Represents a directed graph. The graph is described by an array of connections, each with a 
    /// source and target node ID.
    /// 
    /// The node IDs are actually node indexes, i.e. if there are N unique IDs referred to in the
    /// connection array then the indexes run from 0 to N-1.
    /// 
    /// Elsewhere in sharpneat (e.g. in a NeatGenome) graph node IDs are not necessarily contiguous,
    /// and thus any such graph representation must have its non-contiguous node IDs mapped to zero
    /// based node indexes to be represented by this class. Such node ID mapping is outside the scope
    /// of this class.
    /// 
    /// This class can represent both cyclic or acyclic graphs, however, SharpNEAT uses it in the 
    /// conversion of cyclic NeatGenomes only; a specialized class is used for acyclic graphs that 
    /// gives improved runtime performance for acyclic networks.
    /// 
    /// Specifics
    /// ---------
    /// The connection array is sorted by sourceIdx and secondary sorted by targetIdx. This means that all
    /// connections from a given node are located in a contiguous segment, the start of which can be efficiently
    /// located using a binary search. However to improve efficiency further an array of lookup indexes is compiled
    /// which gives the starting index of a connection span/segment for a given source node index.
    /// </remarks>
