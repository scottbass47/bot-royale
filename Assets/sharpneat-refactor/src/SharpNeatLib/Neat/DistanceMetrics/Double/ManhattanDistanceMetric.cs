    /// Manhattan distance metric.
    /// 
    /// The Manhattan distance is simply the sum total of all of the distances in each dimension. 
    /// Also known as the taxicab distance, rectilinear distance, L1 distance or L1 norm.
    /// 
    /// Use the default constructor for classical Manhattan Distance.
    /// Optionally the constructor can be provided with a two coefficients and a constant that can be used to modify/distort
    /// distance measures. These are:
    /// 
    /// matchDistanceCoeff: When comparing two positions in the same dimension the distance between those two position is 
    /// multiplied by this coefficient.
    /// 
    /// mismatchDistanceCoeff, mismatchDistanceConstant: When comparing two coordinates where one describes a position in a given 
    /// dimension and the other does not then the second coordinate is assumed to be at position zero in that dimension. However,
    /// the resulting distance is multiplied by this coefficient and mismatchDistanceConstant is added, therefore allowing matches and 
    /// mismatches to be weighted differently, e.g. more emphasis can be placed on mismatches (and therefore network topology).
    /// If mismatchDistanceCoeff is zero and mismatchDistanceConstant is non-zero then the distance of mismatches is a fixed value.
    /// 
    /// The two coefficients and constant allow the following schemes:
    /// 
    /// 1) Classical Manhattan distance.
    /// 2) Topology only distance metric (ignore connections weights).
    /// 3) Equivalent of genome distance in Original NEAT (O-NEAT). This is actually a mix of (1) and (2).
