    /// <summary>
    /// A neural network implementation for acyclic networks.
    /// 
    /// Activation of acyclic networks can be far more efficient than cyclic networks because we can activate the network by 
    /// propagating a signal 'wave' from the input nodes through each layer to the output nodes, thus each node
    /// requires activation only once at most, whereas in cyclic networks we must (a) activate each node multiple times and 
    /// (b) have a scheme that defines when to stop activating the network.
    /// 
    /// Algorithm Overview.
    /// 1) The nodes are assigned a depth number based on how many connection hops they are from an input node. Where multiple 
    /// paths to a node exist the longest path determines the node's depth.
    /// 
    /// 2) Connections are similarly assigned a depth value which is defined as the depth of a connection's source node.
    /// 
    /// Note. Steps 1 and 2 are actually performed by AcyclicNetworkFactory.
    /// 
    /// 3) Reset all node activation values to zero. This resets any state from a previous activation.
    /// 
    /// 4) Each layer of the network can now be activated in turn to propagate the signals on the input nodes through the network.
    /// Input nodes do no apply an activation function so we start by activating the connections on the first layer (depth == 0), 
    /// this accumulates node pre-activation signals on all of the target nodes which can be anywhere from depth 1 to the highest 
    /// depth level. Having done this we apply the node activation function for all nodes at the layer 1 because we can now 
    /// guarantee that there will be no more incoming signals to those nodes. Repeat for all remaining layers in turn.
