    /// A neural network class that represents a network with recurrent (cyclic) connections. 
    /// 
    /// This class contains performance improvements described in the following report/post:
    /// 
    ///     http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/research/network-optimisations.html
    /// 
    /// A speed-up over a previous 'naive' implementation was achieved by compactly storing all required data in arrays
    /// in a way that maximizes in-order memory accesses; this allows for good utilisation of CPU caches. 
    /// 
    /// Algorithm Overview.
    /// 1) Loop connections. Each connection gets its input signal from its source node, multiplies this signal by its
    /// weight, and adds the result to its target node's pre-activation variable. Connections are ordered by source node 
    /// index, thus all memory reads here are sequential, but the memory writes to node pre-activation variables are 
    /// non-sequential.
    /// 
    /// 2) Loop nodes. Pass each node's pre-activation signal through the activation function and set its 
    /// post-activation signal value. 
    /// 
    /// The activation loop is now complete and we can go back to (1) or stop.
